# Team Manual-KY 2023 Software Tool

If you team competes in the [**Software & AI** village](https://competition.igem.org/participation/villages) or wants to
apply for the [**Best Software Tool** prize](https://competition.igem.org/judging/awards), you **MUST** host all the
code of your team's software tool in this repository, `main` branch. By the **Wiki Freeze**, a
[release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) will be automatically created as the judging artifact of
this software tool. You will be able to keep working on your software after the Grand Jamboree.

> If your team does not have any software tool, you can totally ignore this repository. If left unchanged, this
repository will be automatically deleted by the end of the season.
